### How was working with MongoDB different from working with PostgreSQL?

I found the coding for both types to be somewhat comparable. For both, there was a need to create a connection to the database, and a need to commit changes to the database.

There are definitely some semantic traps I see myself falling into in the future (particularly, remembering to commit any changes to the PostgreSQL database). In the context of just this week's work, I preferred PostgreSQL because we weren't working with anything super complex, and that kind of rigid structure of data makes more intuitive sense to me compared to the free-floating information that's possible with MongoDB.

### What was easier, and what was harder?

I'm biased into thinking that PostgreSQL is easier simply because the MongoDB assignment was so difficult compared to the PostgreSQL assignment.

That being said, I can definitely see the appeal of MongoDB for Python wizards. It's basically Python (dictionaries) so I'm confident that once I get better with Python I might prefer MongoDB, simply because it'll be much easier to manipulate the information in Python before submitting it to the database. PostgreSQL feels quite restrictive from the Python side, and there's a potential to need a lot of extra cleaning before everything is well structured to place into a query.

We didn't get to deep into the querying process of MongoDB except to submit documents (and a handful of retrieval methods) so that might add some difficulty later, but I feel relatively confident in my understanding of both database managers, given the few days we've had to cover it.
